Hi, I'm Camila and this is my GitHub repository that has whatever, really. Sometimes there are serious bioinformatics tools, sometimes it is just me updating my webpage, and sometimes it is just me messing around with CSS, that has practically nothing to do with bioinformatics in the first place. When I'm not here I'm probably reading low- or high-quality literature, watching YouTube videoessays, talking about videogames, metal and tokusatsu references on Discord, fighting on Reddit, scrollin' on social media to watch lo-fi Sanrio characters doing something or biking.

Fun-fact: Everything in japanese media returns to Ultraman and Kamen Raider.
